A good mission statement tells you what drives a company to do what it does.\n\nCompany policies – Are there company policies that are particularly important to your business? Perhaps your unlimited paternity\u002Fmaternity leave policy has endeared you to employees across the company. This is a good place to talk about that.\n\nExecutive profiles – A company is only as strong as its executive leadership. This is a good place to show off who’s occupying the corner offices.
